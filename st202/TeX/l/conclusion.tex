Any issues with the lecture notes can be reported on the \href{https://github.com/meshkinyar/lecture-notes}{git repository}, by either submitting a pull request or an issue. I am happy to fix any typos or inaccuracies with the content. In addition, feel free to edit my work, just keep my name on it if you're going to publish it somewhere else. The figures can be edited with \href{https://inkscape.org/}{Inkscape}, the software I used to create them. When editing the figures, make sure to save to pdf, and choose the option that exports the text directly to \LaTeX. I hope these notes helped!
